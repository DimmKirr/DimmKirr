# Hey 👋
I’m a Senior Infrastructure Engineer who’s been in the game for more than a decade, most of that spent deep in AWS and building Terraform setups that actually scale. I love making cloud infrastructure simple, reliable, and cost-effective.

### A Few Highlights
- Building and scaling AWS setups for startups
- Created some really useful open-source Terraform modules
- Cut infrastructure costs by 50–70% without sacrificing performance on some projects
- Helped teams hit 99.99% uptime across production environments

### Preferred Stack
- **AWS**: EC2, ECS, EKS, RDS, Lambda, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation, Route53, CloudFront, ALB/NLB, Auto Scaling, and plenty more
- **Terraform**: modules, state management, custom providers, enterprise IaC patterns
- **Coding/Tooling**: Python, Go are the languages of choice. Worked a lot with large codebases of Ruby, NodeJS and some C#.
